# Pig

## Purpose
[Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)#Two-Dice_Pig) is game that can be played with either a single die or two dice. The object of the game is to roll the die or dice to earn points. The amount of points a player earns after rolling the die corresponds to the number rolled; or, in the event that two dice are being rolled, the sum of the dice numbers. A player’s turn doesn’t end until he rolls a 1. If a 1 is rolled, then the respective player also earns no points for that round. For two dice, if two 1’s, which are commonly referred to as snake eyes, are rolled, then the player that rolled the dice loses all the points he has accumulated during the game. The first player to earn one hundred points wins the game.

If a player rolls two dice of the same number, and the dice are neither 1, then the player is obligated to roll the dice again. However, if the player rolls two different numbers that are neither 1, then the player may choose to either roll again or skip the turn. 

Download the .jar file [here](https://github.com/CoderJ01/pig-dice-game/blob/main/assets/jar/pig-dice-game.jar) to run the application. For further assistance, read [this](https://github.com/CoderJ01/how-to-run-jar-files) reference repository.

(NOTE: Upon landing on this page from my [portfolio](https://coderj01.github.io/coding-portfolio-website/), one will notice that I have two projects called "Pig". This is the second attempt at creating the code for the dice game via Java (OOP). The first attempt ([codebase](https://github.com/CoderJ01/pig/blob/main/assets/plain_text/codebase.txt)), created originally in early 2020, is based on C/C++.)
