# Pig

## Purpose
This is a dice game that can be played with either a single die or two dice. The object of the game is to roll the die or dice to earn points. The amount of points a player earns after rolling the die corresponds to the number rolled; or, in the event that two dice are being rolled, the sum of the dice numbers. A player’s turn doesn’t end until he rolls a 1. If a 1 is rolled, then the respective player also earns no points for that round. For two dice, if two 1’s, which are commonly referred to as snake eyes, are rolled, then the player that rolled the dice loses all the points he has accumulated during the game. The first player to earn one hundred points wins the game.

Let's say there are two players playing the game. Player A rolls a 2 and a 3. Player A earns five points (2 + 3 = 5). Player A then rolls two 6’s. Player A now has seventeen points (5 + 6 + 6 = 17). Player A then rolls a 5 and a 2. Player A now has twenty-four points (17 + 5 + 2 = 24). Player A then rolls a 1 and a 6. Player A has earned zero points for that round (24 + 0 = 24), and has to forfeit his turn to Player B. 

Player B rolls two 6’s, so has twelve points (6 + 6 = 12). With luck on his side, Player B rolls two 6’s again, earning him twenty-four points (12 + 6 + 6 = 24). Player B then rolls two 1’s. Player B has now lost all the points he had for the game, and has to forfeit his turn to Player A.

Therefore, so far, Player A has 24 points and Player B has 0 points.

(NOTE: Upon landing on this page from my [portfolio](https://coderj01.github.io/coding-portfolio-website/), one will notice that I have two pieces called "Pig". This is the second attempt at creating the code for the dice game via Java (OOP). The first attempt ([codebase](https://github.com/CoderJ01/pig/blob/main/assets/plain_text/codebase.txt)), created originally in early 2020, is based on C/C++.)
